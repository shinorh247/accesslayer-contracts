// Contract error variants stability and ordering:
//
// IMPORTANT: New error variants MUST be appended to the end of this enum and NEVER
// inserted mid-enum. The numeric discriminant values are part of the contract's ABI and
// are exposed to clients, indexers, and monitoring tools.
//
// Consequences of Reordering:
// If a variant is inserted mid-enum or existing variants are reordered:
// - Existing clients that match on numeric error codes will break
// - Indexers and monitoring tools will misinterpret error types
// - Historical error logs will become inconsistent with current definitions
// - Contract upgrades will introduce silent behavioral changes
//
// Safe Extension Pattern:
// Append new variants at the end.
// Contract error variants.

    /// This helper is used in quote accumulator paths (e.g., dividend distribution) where
    /// adding a per-key-net amount to the current accumulator must not overflow.
    /// Unlike `checked_fee_sum` which returns `Option<T>`, this returns a `ContractError`

    ///
